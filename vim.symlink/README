This configuration works by means of symbolic links that point to the files
under this directory. Hence, do not move or copy these files! Every ".symlink"
file should be pointed by a symbolic link in your home directory 
(e.g. ~/.foo -> ~/.dotfiles/foo.symlink).

You must execute the following commands in your home directory in order to
create the necessary symbolic links:

$ cd ~
$ ln -s .dotfiles/vim.symlink .vim
$ ln -s .dotfiles/vim.symlink/vimrc.symlink .vimrc
